# Controlling-Computer-with-Hand-Gestures-using-Ultrasonic-Sensors
We place two Ultrasonic Sensors on the top of our monitor and will read the distance between the monitor and our hand using Arduino. Based on this value of distance,we will perform certain actions. To perform actions on our computer we use Python pyautogui library.The commands from Arduino are sent to the computer through serial port (USB).This data will be then read by python which is running on the computer and based on the read data an action will be performed.
